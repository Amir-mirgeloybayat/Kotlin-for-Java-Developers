# Kotlin-for-Java-Developers
"Kotlin for Java Developers" is a course on Coursera website designed by JetBrains for developers who are already familiar with Java.
Kotlin is a robust and fairly new language and is currently being used in multi-platform and mobile projects,
server-side and web frontend, and of course, Android.
You can use Kotlin and Java interchangeably. 
Both Java and Kotlin are compiled to bytecode. Therefore, at the bytecode level, the machine is essentially dealing with the same thing
and this might be one of the reasons why you can change a whole Java project into Kotlin or,
just introduce a small fraction of Kotlin code to a Java project.
Kotlin is statically typed, and has type inference, meaning the compiler can infer the type if the context is clear enough.

A helpful link, if you'd like to read the documentation and learn by example:
https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/01_introduction/01_Hello%20world

My notes start from the second week of the course. Nothing to worry about, you haven't missed anything big. The first week
is just on some introductory material which could be gone over more in depth on: https://kotlinlang.org/

I will be posting my personal notes from the second week and on for other enthusiastic coders.
Happy coding!
